Now we have the basics of how to declare arrays, store values in the array, and access these values, lets switch to see how to make use of this. In the following video we go through the thinking behind working with arrays. This will help equip you with the tools to start building different functionality when working with arrays in your code.

Have a go at building a total level function, that outputs the length of all the names in the array.

:::caution[Calculating string length]

SplashKit now has a `length_of` function you can use to calculate the length of a string. The video access this on the string data itself, but try instead to use the `length_of` function in your code. We will explore member functions at a later stage.

      {
          // Store in the i-th element of the array
          // i changes each loop - so this will store in names[0], names[1], ...
          names[i] = read_string("Enter a name: ");
          i = i + 1; // increment i... could be written as i++
      }

      // Access elements in the array to write out names entered
      // Use a for loop to combine the loop control
      //  - i is initialised to 0
      //  - the loop continues while i is less than SIZE
      //  - i is incremented each loop (at the end)
      for(i = 0; i < SIZE; i++)
      {
          write_line(names[i]);
      }

      // Use the total_length function to calculate the total length of all the names
      write_line("Total length of all names: " + to_string(total_length(names, SIZE)));

      return 0;
  }

:::tip

Remember to think about what you can do **for each** element in an array. The computer runs in sequence, working one step at a time. So we need to align our thinking with that.
