The next part of the journey will be spectacular! We are going to see how to take control of the sequence of instructions that the computer runs. This will greatly enhance what you can do with the computer, giving you the tools you need to start building much more interesting programs.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter you should be able to: 

- Use branching and looping control flow statements.
- Design algorithms to achieve required outcomes.
- Demonstrate how a given algorithm functions and explain the purpose of the control flow statements it is using.
- Use the debugger to explore control flow within a program.
